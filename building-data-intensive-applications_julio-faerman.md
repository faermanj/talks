Description
-----------

Building data-intensive applications requires different decisions than traditional request processing. The issues begin with reliably ingesting a firehose of data, as in modern sentiment analysis or device telemery applications. Volume, velocity and complexity in data can change how it is stored, processed, analyzed and visualized. The solution depends on how "intensive" data is. Some may handle huge volume and throughput, others minimal latencies, or even keeping up with both. All that while ensuring security and privacy. Join this presentation and let's discuss design choices, implementation references, common problems and food for thought about data-intensive apps.
